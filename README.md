# Skribbl.io-Project
*Make an app that is better than skribbl.io in enough ways to pull people away from skribbl and to your new app.*

### Introduction
*I might add content on the go if I feel like you guys can use that.*

### Scenario
*Hi, My name is Rafael, I work for DD Technix we primarily try to have a web presence in any way we can.* 
*Recently we saw skribbl.io became big, very big and we want to be part of that.*

*Seeing as how skribbl isn't that old yet, we feel like we want to jump on the bandwagon and join in on this ludicrous idea.*
*Obviously skribbl has more popularity right now, so we need to make sure we please the end user enough to make them jump ship and use our app instead.*

*This means we can't use a hard pay wall, since people won't jump to our app if skribbl is free.* 
*Find us a way to monetize this app as well as get the end user excited about en stay that way for our app.*

### Clear instructions
  * Make an app that is better than skribbl.io in enough ways to pull people away from skribbl and to your new app. 
  * Doing this assignment, means doing all the "extra" work around it as well, here it is explained: 

### Pitch your idea to the client
  * Divide the work between your frontend and backend team (don't forget, coordination will still be important)
  * Setup a roadmap and send this to the client (Read about roadmaps here)
  * Deliver on the promises and the final work
  * Pitch your final work, show it to the entire group and your client too.
